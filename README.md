# Foodzilla 🍕

### 🚨IMPORTANT!🚨 Due to the sudden discontinuation of the Food2Fork API, a lightweight version
### has been moved to Heroku. Recipe search terms are therefore limited to "Pizza", "Pasta"
### and "Salad" (A little something for everyone 🥕).

#### Description

Vanilla ES6+ App, that lets you search recipes from the Food2Fork API.

This application lets you search and view recipes gotten through a limited version of the old (now defunct)
Food2Fork API. It also lets you modify the amount of ingredients for each recipe, based on how many people
you want to cook for - it then lets you add these ingredients to a shopping-list, for later use.

The application also utilizes Localstorage. You can like recipes by clicking on the heart icon - which
then adds the recipe to a persistable list, that the user can access in the top, right-hand corner
of the application.
